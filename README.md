# UK Customer segmentation for market analysis

The data collection took place from a UK-based, officially registered non-store online retail entity. Our primary aim revolves around recognizing transaction patterns and categorizing clientele. Customer categorization involves the procedure of classifying customers into sets based on their shared actions or other characteristics. These sets should display internal uniformity while also possessing diversity relative to one another.

The central objective is to pinpoint customers generating the highest profits, as well as those who have ceased engagement, in order to avert subsequent customer attrition. This can be achieved by revising corporate policies. Given the substantial customer base, each exhibiting distinct requirements, it becomes pivotal to ascertain the most pivotal customers for the enterprise and to tactically direct efforts towards them. The Elbow method and Silhouette analysis were applied to determine the optimal cluster quantity.
